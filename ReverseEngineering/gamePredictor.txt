#DetermineWinner function
The function DetermineWinner takes 2 inputes for each team, the teams minimum possible values and the maximum they can reach.
The calculator checks if the minimum points of a team are higher than maximum a team can score.
This approach is accurate but isn't very effective because it just tells us if the team is completely overpowered. 

#GamePredictor function
Doesn't take in any information
Gets the spreadsheet and predictionSheet
It sets the current sheet to the predictionSheet
Creates different variables for the blue and red team.
Runs the other calculator functions.
Takes the information from the calculators and gets the RSD
Uses the RSD to find the standard deviation for both teams
Takes the average total points for the teams.
Uses the standard deviation and the average of both teams to find the max and min for each.
These variables will be used in the DetermineWinner function.
Checks if the minimum is negative and sets it to 0 if it is.
