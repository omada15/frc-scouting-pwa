#CalculateClimb function
Take in the allianceColor as an input(We should use a set of team numbers)
Gets the spreadsheet and predictionSheet
Takes the climbData information
It checks how far it gets on average and tells you how much every robot gets on average each game

#ClimbCalculator function
Uses the CalculateClimb function to read the information for each of the teams instead of just one
(We can probably just combine the two and create a singular function which intakes 6 inputs(Team numbers))
